Installation
===============

pydsol-model is available using pip install. It can be installed with the URL::

 pip install git+https://github.com/imvs95/pydsol-model.git


For setting up pydsol-model and ensuring that the example models can run, ``pydsol-core`` also needs to be installed. This is part of the ``requirements.txt``.
If you want to install it manually, use::

    pip install pydsol-core

The source code of that library can be found at https://github.com/averbraeck/pydsol-core.
