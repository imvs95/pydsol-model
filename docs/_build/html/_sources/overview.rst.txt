pydsol-model provides a set of predefined model objects to construct and run a discrete event simulation model.
Discrete event simulation models are event-based, meaning that events within a simulation model are executed from event to event that can vary in time.
No fixed time for a event is scheduled; this happens for agent-based simulation models (ticks) and system dynamics. Discrete event simulation models
have a continuous simulation time. This is important for understanding the code of the model object. Each step within a model object is, therefore, scheduled using an event
instead of passing it on to the next function (which often happens in Python).

The following model objects are provided::
